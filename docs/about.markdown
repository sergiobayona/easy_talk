# About EasyTalk

EasyTalk is a Ruby library for defining and generating JSON Schema from Ruby classes. Inspired by Python's Pydantic library, it provides an ActiveModel-like interface for defining structured data models with automatic validation and JSON Schema generation.

## Why EasyTalk?

- **Type Safety** - Define your data structures once and get validation automatically
- **JSON Schema Generation** - Produce standards-compliant JSON Schema from Ruby code
- **LLM Integration** - Generate function schemas for OpenAI and other LLM providers
- **ActiveModel Compatible** - Works with Rails forms, validations, and serialization

## Use Cases

- **API Request/Response Validation** - Define expected shapes for API payloads
- **LLM Function Calling** - Generate structured output schemas for AI applications
- **Configuration Files** - Validate configuration against a schema
- **Data Pipelines** - Ensure data conforms to expected structures
