## [3.3.0] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- **Schema Objects in additionalProperties**: Extended `additionalProperties` to support type constraints and schema objects (#160)
  - New syntax: `additional_properties Integer, minimum: 0, maximum: 100`
  - Three supported forms: boolean, type class, or type with constraints
  - Generates full JSON Schema for additional properties validation
  - New methods: `ObjectBuilder#process_additional_properties`, `ObjectBuilder#build_additional_properties_schema`
  - Fully backwards compatible with existing boolean usage

  - New configuration options:
    - `base_schema_uri` - Base URI for auto-generating $id values
    - `auto_generate_ids` - Enable automatic $id generation (default: false)
    - `prefer_external_refs` - Use external URI in $ref when model has $id (default: false)
  - Three-level schema ID resolution: explicit per-model → auto-generated → global
  - Dynamic $ref templates conditionally use external URIs or local `#/$defs/ModelName` format
  - Supports composition types (T::OneOf, T::AnyOf, T::AllOf) with external refs

- **T::Tuple Type for Positional Array Validation**: New tuple type for JSON Schema tuple support (#154, #155)
  - New syntax: `property :coords, T::Tuple[Float, Float]`
  - Generates JSON Schema with `items` as array of schemas
  - Supports `additional_items: false`, `true`, or a type constraint
  - Combines with array constraints: `min_items`, `max_items`, `unique_items`
  - ActiveModel validation for runtime type checking at each position
  - New files: `lib/easy_talk/types/tuple.rb`, `lib/easy_talk/builders/tuple_builder.rb`

  - Auto-defined `count_present_properties` private method on model classes
  - Thread-safe validator application with double-checked locking

### Changed

- **Format Validation Enhancements**: Improved format validation accuracy and security (#157, #156, #144)
  - **Scope Fix**: Format and pattern validations now only apply to string values (per JSON Schema spec)
  - **URI/URL Validation**: Uses `URI.parse()` with `.absolute?` check instead of regex
  - **Parsing-Based Validators**: Date, DateTime, and Time formats now use parsing instead of regex
  - **Email Validation**: Replaced ReDoS-vulnerable regex with simple linear-time pattern
  - New validation methods: `apply_uri_format_validation`, `apply_date_format_validation`, `apply_datetime_format_validation`, `apply_time_format_validation`

- **JSON Schema Equality for uniqueItems**: Implements correct JSON Schema equality semantics for array uniqueness (#152)
  - Objects with same keys/values in different order are equal
  - Numbers are mathematically equal (1 == 1.0)
  - Type matters for non-numbers (true != 1, false != 0)
  - New module: `EasyTalk::JsonSchemaEquality` with `normalize()` and `duplicates?()` methods
  - MAX_DEPTH = 100 limit to prevent SystemStackError on deeply nested structures

- **Array Presence Validation**: Required array properties now properly reject nil values (#140)
  - New method: `apply_array_presence_validation()` for array-specific nil checks

## [1.0.2] - 2024-13-01
- Support "AdditionalProperties". see https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object#additionalproperties
You can now define a schema that allows any additional properties. 
```ruby
class Company
  include EasyTalk::Model

  define_schema do
    property :name, String
    additional_properties true # or false
  end
end
```

You can then do:
```ruby
company = Company.new
company.name = "Acme Corp" # Defined property
company.location = "New York" # Additional property
company.employee_count = 100 # Additional property
```

company.as_json
# => {
#      "name" => "Acme Corp",
#      "location" => "New York",
#      "employee_count" => 100
#    }
```
- Fix that we don't conflate nilable properties with optional properties.
## [1.0.1] - 2024-09-01
- Fixed that property with custom type does not ignore the constraints hash https://github.com/sergiobayona/easy_talk/issues/17
## [1.0.0] - 2024-06-01
- Use `Hash` instead of `:object` for inline object schema definition.
example:
```ruby
    property :email, Hash do

        property :verified, :boolean
    end
```
- Loosen up the gemspec version requirement. Makes it flexible to use the library with future versions of Rails (i.e 8.*).
- Removed JSONScheemer gem dependency. 
- The library does not validate by default anymore. Validating an instance requires that you explicitly define ActiveModel validations in your EasyTalk model. See: https://github.com/sergiobayona/easy_talk/blob/main/spec/easy_talk/activemodel_integration_spec.rb.
- Internal improvements to `EasyTalk::ObjectBuilder` class. No changes to the public API.
